<p class="center p2"><strong>CHEERS OF THE PRESS!</strong></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Ingoldsby, Thomas Hood, W. S. Gilbert,&mdash;these are the names that
occur to one in trying to 'place' Mr. Parkes after reading this volume of
rollicking, verbal and pictorial fun. <span class="smcap">The Spook Ballads</span> are in no sense imitations
of any of those classics of the comic muse, yet we find in them the same
thorough abandonment to 'the humour of the thing.'"&mdash;<cite>The Publisher's Circular.</cite></p>

<p class="bb prose">"A substantial volume introducing a Comic Poet, who in the future
may give us a modern Ingoldsby. Mr. Parkes has an intellectual touch to
his drollery and his sense of the possible humours of versification is
pleasantly keen, the <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span> is far above the contemporary average
of the lighter rhymesters. Mr. Parkes wields a sprightly pencil, and he
has illustrated his verses lavishly and with effect."&mdash;<cite>The Stage.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Not only are the literary merit of these fantastic ballads of a high
order, but the illustrations by the author are of such a humorous nature
as to give a unique pleasure to the reader."&mdash;<cite>The Morning Leader.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Well written, well illustrated, and funny is a combination of good
qualities not often met with even in the Spook world, so Messrs. Simpkin,
Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, and Co., ought to be well pleased with their
publication."&mdash;<cite>The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Dealing largely with ghosts and legends embracing a dash of diablerie
such as would have been dear to the heart of Ingoldsby. There is a rugged
force in 'The Girl of Castlebar' that will always make it tell in recitation; and
even greater success in this direction has attended 'The Fairy Queen,' a story
unveiling the seamy side, with quaint humour and stern realism. It is specially
worthy of note that Mr. Parkes's skill in versification has received the warmest
acknowledgment from those best qualified to appreciate the bright local coloring
as well as the blending of fancy and fun."&mdash;<cite>Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"A cheery and spirited production, and full of fun; the style reminds
one of 'Bon Gaultier,' the style and illustrations combined inevitably
recall the famous 'Bab Ballads.' Indeed it is hard to say which is the
most felicitous, the draughtsman or the poet."&mdash;<cite>The Bookseller.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"In the attractive <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span>, the talented Irish artist has
displayed qualities to a remarkable degree. There are many pieces reciters
will be glad to lay hold of, while the Ballads and Illustrations are full of
the pleasing humour which characterises all Mr. Parkes' work, and which
will serve to cheer and to amuse many readers."&mdash;<cite>The Sun.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"As the combined production of a clever pencil and a clever pen, this
volume may be said to be unique. These poems are pure fun of the most
entirely frolicsome kind, hung upon the peg of a quaint idea. 'The
German Band' rises to a really tragic pathos. The illustrations are either
quaint, droll, or dainty, or partake of broad caricature."&mdash;<cite>The Citizen.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"It contains a store of humour that will delight and amuse the reader,
who will be sure to re-read the many capital lays. Just the thing for
reciters. The Artist, his own Illustrator, shines here as conspicuously as
in the kindred branch of Authorship."&mdash;<cite>British and Colonial Printer and
Stationer.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Mr. Parkes is clever and polished alike in the expression of humour
and pathos. Indescribably funny is his story of the deluge as told by
'Antediluvian Pat O'Toole,' and a note of grim tragedy is struck in the
tale of 'John McKune.' Rollicking lays, many of them admirably
adapted for recitation, go to make a delightful book, which has the uncommon
merit of being well illustrated by Mr. Parkes, who is as skilful an
artist as he is an author."&mdash;<cite>Photographic Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"<span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span> possess an amount of boisterous humour and variety
of quaint versification which make them excellent and refreshing reading.
The book owes a good deal of its charm to the author's clever and
laughable illustrations which are plentifully besprinkled in its pages."&mdash;<cite>The
Weekly Sun</cite>.</p>

<p class="prose bb">"There is a good store of pleasant humour in <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span>, by
Theodore Parkes, who also has a happy gift with the pencil, as witness
the illustrations, the fare he provides certainly deserves a really grateful
'grace after meat.'"&mdash;<cite>The People.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"In his attractive volume, <span class="smcap">The Spook Ballads</span>, Mr. Theodore Parkes
has shown himself to be not only an author but an artist of considerable
talents."&mdash;<cite>Weekly Budget.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"The fun is good humoured and light-hearted, and better than most
popular verse as to rhyme and metre. The illustrations are really clever
and range from broad farce to charming little head and tail pieces that are
graceful and suggestive."&mdash;<cite>Borderland.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"&mdash;&mdash; Ballads all of which are undeniably clever. A book which will
be gratefully turned to by all who seek occasional relaxation in the best of
good company."&mdash;<cite>The Surveyor.</cite></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo003b.jpg" width="400" height="102" alt="decoration" />
</div>

<p class="prose bb">"A clever collection of poems illustrated by their author and deserve
great popularity. The author is well known in London literary circles in
which he has given several of the pieces here presented as recitations."&mdash;<cite>The
Lamp.</cite></p>

<p class="bb">"Irrespective of the pleasure to be derived from reading the Ballads,
the book is well worth obtaining for the author's remarkably clever
illustrations."&mdash;<cite>South London Press.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"A facile flow of versification, keen sense of humour, and a good
mastery of English as she is spoke by Irish, German and other nationalities,
as well as how she should be spoken, characterise this book of ballads.
The sketches are well adapted to the themes."&mdash;<cite>Manchester Courier.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"'The Colonel and the Cook' is not only genuine farce in conception,
but felicitous anti-pathos in the execution."&mdash;<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"These Ballads are as original and racy and facetious as any I have
come across for a long time; Parkes's pencil is a lively companion for his
pen; the two of them rollick and frolic down page after page in a state of
hilarity that would dissipate and dispose of the worst attack of 'blues.'
The sun does not shine every day, and when the hour is dark and dreary
there will be found enlivement and joviality and wholesome entertainment
within the covers of this volume."&mdash;<cite>Free Lance in the Weekly Irish Times.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"If any of our readers wish to enjoy a long and pleasant life let
them ask for <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span>! there is abundance of mirth, fun, wit and
merriment in this beautiful volume."&mdash;<cite>Munster Express.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"About as laugh-inspiring verse as perhaps ever issued from the
Press, the <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span> are one and all conceived in a most
exuberant spirit of drollery. There is a laugh almost in every line,
fun galore bubbles through every page. Where could one find a more
touching combination of humour and pathos than the dedication lines
'Bohemians Hail!' There are lines in it worthy of some of the best touches
of Poe. The book is a book for <cite>bon vivants</cite>. It is a veritable ode to conviviality,
and its pages teeming with most artistic illustrations. Alive with
ever-recurring flashes of wit and drollery, will afford many a pleasant hour
to all to whom a laugh is welcome."&mdash;<cite>United Ireland.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"A delightful diverting volume, from cover to cover, of the sixty-one
ballads before us; not one halts, they are all boisterous with bubbling mirth
and frolic. Happy the man who in a moment of ill humour, lights on a copy
of <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span>. Fun of this kind is contagious, and before he has
dipped far into Mr. Parkes' pages he will have forgotten his temper or
his ennui. The book is full too of social satire, with touches of biting
realism."&mdash;<cite>The Freeman's Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"Most amusingly humorous verses cleverly and quaintly illustrated,
and, like all genuine humour, teaches many a needed and important lesson
in morals and the conduct of life, and hits sharp blows at hypocrisy and
current shams and humbugs. Surely the author must have had Jabez
Balfour and the Liberator swindle in his mind when he composed the scathing
ballad entitled 'The Devil in Richmond Park.'"&mdash;<cite>The Christian Age.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"This is a very charming and winning volume. Everything about
the book is an incentive to make a prompt acquaintance with its literary
merits. Mr. Parkes is a consummate artist in verse, and through all runs
the same vein of drollery, of pungency, of real humour difficult to resist,
and which makes us wish for more, and much more from so entertaining a
pen."&mdash;<cite>The Carlow Sentinel.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"A collection of humorous verses quaintly and cleverly illustrated by
his own pencil. The author has a broad vein of humour."&mdash;<cite>Evening News</cite>
(<em>London</em>).</p>

<p class="prose bb">"When parties perusing this volume have completed its 250 pages
they will only regret that it is not double its size."&mdash;<cite>The Irish Times.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"The naivete of the wit is most irresistible, and the humour most
amusing. 'The Ghost of Hampton Court' and 'The spirit that held him
down' are both decidedly clever, but it is to 'The Girl of Castlebar,' 'The
Fairy Queen' and 'Why did ye die?" we turn for all that is most original
and sparkling. The volume itself is as tastefully finished outside as it is
wittily furnished and illustrated inside."&mdash;<cite>King's County Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"<span class="smcap">The Spook Ballads</span> will greatly amuse the class of readers who
prefer a good hearty laugh to the emotions produced by 'Paradise lost'
or 'Hamlet.' The book is crammed with fun of the funniest sort, though
it contains many passages which possess a value above mere jollity."&mdash;<cite>Glasgow
Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"There is no lack of rollicking fun in <span class="smcap">The Spook Ballads</span>. The pieces
are always amusing in idea, and the free sweep of the verse has a certain
buoyancy which carries a reader pleasantly along."&mdash;<cite>The Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"The humourous drawings are charming, and the figure subjects and
decorative designs show great versatility and skill. Mr. Parkes has a
wonderful way of introducing odd expressions, quaint conceits, and grotesque
imagery. Many a hearty laugh will be got out of the <span class="smcap">Spook Ballads</span>."&mdash;<cite>The
Aberdeen Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"The illustrations by the Author copiously strewn throughout the
work are exceedingly clever, and are in themselves enough to commend the
book, and will appeal to readers endowed with a particle of humour.
Altogether the book is the kind to cheer the winter fireside or make the
summer holiday slide joyously into autumn."&mdash;<cite>Kirkudbrightshire Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class="prose bb">"The pages abound in illustrations and marginal etchings, and these
display rare artistic skill and a genuine spirit of comicality."&mdash;<cite>The Derry
Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="prose">"John M'Kune is racy of the soil, and rests on something stranger
than fiction."&mdash;<cite>The Tyrone Constitution.</cite></p>

THE following verses, a remarkable supernatural
interview is narrated. It is now for the first time
launched into publicity, on the authority, and with the approbation of a
quaint old friend of mine, Professor Simon Chuffkrust, a savant who has
daringly groped his way through certain gloomy mysteries of occult science.</p>

<p>The confidential and impressive manner of Chuffkrust, is jewelled with
eyes of sparkling jet, semitoned behind a screen of moonblue spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>

His voice is of such convincing suasion, that it is a novel and interesting
experience to hear him relate with circumstantial enthusiasm, the ghostly
interview afforded him by a fortuitous chance within the interesting
grounds of Hampton Court. His is a testimony most reliable, and
calculated to establish as a fact the actual presence of supernatural
shadows in that historic locality.</p>

<p>It also hints at the necessity, and use, of making the ghost a more
familiar study, whereby the belated world would rid itself of much
unnecessary fright, consequent on the invariable habit of spasmodically
avoiding the familiar advances of the common or bedroom spook.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><div class="dropcap">I</div>N Hampton Court I wandered on a twilight evening grey,</div>
<div class="i0">Amidst its mazy precincts I had lost my tourist way,</div>
<div class="i0">And while I cogitated, on a seat of carven stone,</div>
<div class="i0">I heard beneath an orange tree, an elongated groan!</div>
<div class="i0">I crinkled with astonishment, 'twas not a fit of fright,</div>
<div class="i0">For loud elastic wailings, I have heard at twelve at night,</div>
<div class="i0">The midnight peace disturbing in the lamplit streets below,</div>
<div class="i0">But this was uttered in an unfamiliar groan of woe,</div>
<div class="i0">And Hampton Court I wot had got some questionable nooks,</div>
<div class="i0">In which it harboured spectres, and disreputable spooks,</div>
<div class="i0">In which it shrouded headless Queens, and shades of evil Kings</div>
<div class="i0">With ill-conditioned titled knaves, in lemans leading strings.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I listened! 'twas a voice that cried as 'twere from out the dust</div>
<div class="i0">Of time, that clogged its music, with a husk of mould and rust,</div>
<div class="i0">A voice that once as tenor, might have won a slight repute,</div>
<div class="i0">But combination now of asthma, whooping cough, and flute.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I sauntered towards the orange tree, and lo! the gloaming thro'</div>
<div class="i0">I saw a man in trunk and hose, and silver buckled shoe,</div>
<div class="i0">With ruffles and embroidered vest, in wig without a hat,</div>
<div class="i0">Inclining to the contour, which is designated fat.</div>
<div class="i0">Just then the waxing moonlight bloomed behind, and lifed the stain
</div>

</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
<div class="i0">Of color thro' him, like a Saint upon a window pane,</div>
<div class="i0">I could not spare such noted chance; so stepping from the gloom,</div>
<div class="i0">I bowed politely and exclaimed</div>
<div class="i2">"A Spectre I presume?"</div>
<div class="i0">With glad pathetic wondered look, but still in tones of woe,</div>
<div class="i0">He answered thus, "Alack! ah me I am exactly so"</div>
<div class="i0">And confidential gleam of hope across his features grew,</div>
<div class="i0">Which gave me courage thus to start a social interview.</div>
<div class="i0">"I pray of thee to speak, alas! why grims it so with thee?</div>
<div class="i0">Some evil canker nips thy peace, divulge thy wrongs to me,</div>
<div class="i0">That I may give thee hope, for I am one to sympathize</div>
<div class="i0">With manhood's lamentation, as with womanhood, her sighs,</div>
<div class="i0">But ha! Mayhap it fits your jest, with elongated groan,</div>
<div class="i0">To seek to fright me, as I'm here in Hampton Court alone,</div>
<div class="i0">To wreck my spirits as of old has been the game of spook,"</div>
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/img15ba.jpg" width="300" height="237" alt="illustration" /></div>

<div class="i0">The spectre turned upon me with a sad reproachful look.</div>
<div class="i0">And cried, "Alack! that living men, so long have held it good,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
<div class="i0">To flee from Ghosts, and hence the Ghost is not yet understood,</div>

<div class="i0">Now as for me, I moan it not, for jest of idle sport,</div>
<div class="i0">My task, it is as murdered Ghost, to haunt in Hampton Court!</div>
<div class="i0">I play the victim to a spook, who chucked me down a stair,</div>
<div class="i0">Thro' being caught too near my lady's bedroom unaware."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Poor shade of ill mischance!" I sobbed, the while a wayward tear,</div>
<div class="i0">Tricked out along my nose, and lodged upon my tunic here,</div>
<div class="i0">"I pray that thou would'st tell me all, withholding ne'er a jot,</div>
<div class="i0">For I might do thee service, in some most unlikely spot,"</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"O blessed chance!" the Ghost exclaimed, "Thou art the only one</div>
<div class="i0">Of all men else, who spoke me so, they always turn and run!</div>
<div class="i0">Thou art the first, that I have seen drop sympathetic tears,</div>
<div class="i0">Responsive to my moanings, aye for full one hundred years!</div>
<div class="i0">And so I feel that I can speak in unreserving tone,</div>
<div class="i0">And give thee cause for this alack! my chronic nightly groan!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When I was in my thirties, I engaged to mind the spoons,</div>
<div class="i0">Of Colonel Sir John Bouncer, of the Sixty-fifth Dragoons,</div>
<div class="i0">And tho' of lowly stature, I am proud I was by half,</div>
<div class="i0">More manly than the footman, by step, and chest, and calf.</div>
<div class="i0">With frontispiece well favored, in a frame of powdered wig,</div>
<div class="i0">I wot amongst the female sex, I joyed a game of tig,</div>
<div class="i0">I played the captivating spark, till Colonel Bouncer caught</div>
<div class="i0">Me jesting with my Mistress, and he spake with furious haught,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
<div class="i0">Expressed him his disfavor loud, unto my Lady thus,</div>
<div class="i0">"An' thou do not discharge the knave, 'twill cause some future fuss,</div>
<div class="i0">The cock-a-dandy bantam, pillory graduate, and scoff</div>
<div class="i0">On manhood, give him notice!" but no, she begged me off.</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">It was not long thereafter, an early postman bore</div>
<div class="i0">A warrant for the Colonel, to start for Singapore,</div>
<div class="i0">He sailed, and in the August, 'twas just ten months away</div>
<div class="i0">He stayed, and he was due in town, upon the first of May,</div>
<div class="i0">Twas on that ninth of August at twelve o'clock at night,</div>
<div class="i0">'Thro Bouncer Hall I wandered, to see that all was right;</div>
<div class="i0">And in my course of searching, to check the silver stock,</div>
<div class="i0">I chanced upon the key, with which my Lady wound the clock,</div>
<div class="i0">A Louis clock she valued, it was on the mantel shelf</div>
<div class="i0">In her boudoir, her habit was to wind it up herself,</div>
<div class="i0">I brought it to her bedroom, and scratched a single knock,</div>
<div class="i0">And asked her through the keyhole, if she had wound the clock.</div>
</div>

<img src="images/illo017a.jpg" width="200" height="204" alt="illustration" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">My words were scarcely uttered, when from another door,</div>
<div class="i0">I heard a foot, that should have been that night in Singapore!</div>
<div class="i0">I saw an eye, that should have seen that night a foreign shore,</div>
<div class="i6">"Ha! Caitiff knave!!" He shouted,</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas all I heard, no more,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<div class="i0">He collared me by neck, and breech, and swept me off the floor,</div>
<div class="i6">And bore me down the corridor,</div>
<div class="i0">And hoisting me as light as cork, an act I could not check,</div>
<div class="i0">He flung me down the oaken stair, and wanton cracked my neck!</div>
<div class="i0">For that he paid the penalty, one day on Tyburn tree,</div>
<div class="i0">Alack! it was the sorest deed, the Law could wreak for me</div>
<div class="i0">For when it made a Ghost of him, he came, and sought me out,</div>
<div class="i0">Where haunting at my Lady's door, I heard the self-same shout,</div>
<div class="i2">Of "Caitiff knave!!"</div>
<div class="i4">The pity on't! he took me unaware,</div>
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo018a.jpg" width="200" height="318" alt="illustration" />
</div>
<div class="i0">Once more by gripping of my breech, and tossed me down the stair!</div>
<div class="i0">Night after night he compassed it, nor recked he who was there</div>
<div class="i0">But by my crop, and grip of trunks, he bumped me down the stair!</div>
<div class="i0">Thus mortified by evil fate, his widow nightly wept,</div>
<div class="i0">To hear the periodic row, and scarce a wink she slept;</div>
<div class="i0">She daily sought to lay his ghost by penance and by prayer,</div>
<div class="i0">And got a brace of saintly monks, to exorcise the scare</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<div class="i0">With holy water sprinked about, a jot he did not care!</div>
<div class="i0">But seized me with a fiercer grip, and jocked me down the stair!</div>
<div class="i0">And mocked the frightened monks, who flew, with fringe of standing hair.</div>
<div class="i0">At last his widow could not reck his evil conduct there,</div>
<div class="i10">She moved to otherwhere.</div>
<div class="i0">The only tenants that remained in Bouncer Hall, were rats,</div>
<div class="i0">Until 'twas taken down, to build some fashionable flats,</div>
<div class="i0">And when the workmen moved the stair, I wot he was cut up,</div>
<div class="i0">To see its broken banisters, upon a cart put up.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But vengeance of his hate for me, remained a danger yet,</div>
<div class="i0">To find a suitable resort, to work it out he set,</div>
<div class="i0">And tapped the telephone, until he heard of that resort;</div>
<div class="i0">It is an antient oaken stair, that's here in Hampton Court,</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas vacant of a Ghost, I faith, a lobby to be let,</div>
<div class="i0">And with some Royal Spook, he had a ghostly compact set,</div>
<div class="i0">And then he brought me here to work, his midnight murder yet.</div>
<div class="i0">An hour ago, accosting me, says he to me, "Prepare!</div>
<div class="i0">Be ready! for once more to-night, I'll crock thee down the stair!</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">To-night, a cousin German of the noble house of Teck</div>
<div class="i0">Will occupy the bedroom, and I'll have to crack thy neck!"</div>
<div class="i0">In yonder wing, and up the stairs as high as thou canst go,</div>
<div class="i0">There is the bedroom, with a door, of casement rather low,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<div class="i0">And if thou stay a night therein, thy sleep might wake for shock,</div>
<div class="i0">Of scratching on the door, and keyhole cry, to wind your clock,</div>
<div class="i0">And then the shout of</div>
<div class="i10">"Caitiff knave!"</div>
<div class="i12">And if thou'rt bold and dare,</div>
<div class="i0">To peer out on that lobby then, he crocks me down the stair!</div>
<div class="i0">And leaves thee shivering in thy shirt, with fright and besomed hair!</div>
<div class="i0">I've heard the County Council, for the City weal is rife,</div>
<div class="i0">I'd hold it as a favor, if thou'ds't intimate that life</div>
<div class="i0">Is perilled on that lobby, and suggest in thy report,</div>
<div class="i0">That lifts would be more suitable, than stairs in Hampton Court.</div>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo020a.jpg" width="200" height="221" alt="illustration" /></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then with a comprehensive wail of anguish at his fate,</div>
<div class="i0">He gradually vanished thro' the grating of a gate,</div>
<div class="i0">And left me sorely puzzled, in a sad reflective state,</div>
<div class="i0">Then up a creeping tree, and spout, with stern resolve of hate</div>
<div class="i0">Compressed within my breast for Bouncer's evil ghost I clomb,</div>
<div class="i6">And slipping thro' the window frame with feline caution dumb,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a>
</span><div class="i0">I slid behind a folding screen, and with a craning neck,</div>
<div class="i0">I listened for the snoring of the Colonel Van der Teck,</div>
<div class="i8">But not a soul had come that night into the room to rest,</div>
<div class="i8">There was no cousin German, and the bed was yet unpressed;</div>
<div class="i0">A knavish and mendacious trick it was of Bouncer's Ghost,</div>
<div class="i0">To crack his butler's neck again, but with some beans and toast,</div>
<div class="i8">I picketed behind the door, on eager ear to catch,</div>
<div class="i8">The slightest human murmur, thro' the keyhole of the latch,</div>
<div class="i0">At last it came! the midnight yet, was booming from a clock,</div>
<div class="i0">When lo! a scratching on the door, and half-way thro' the lock,</div>
<div class="i0">I heard the question, and with shout, I gave the ghosts a shock,</div>
<div class="i0">By springing to the lobby, like a chip of blasting rock!</div>
<div class="i0">And bounded twixt the spectres, with the rage of fighting cock,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then facing Colonel Bouncer's Ghost, "Thou caitiff spook" I cried,</div>
<div class="i0">"Was it for this, that Shakespeare wrote, and Colonel Hampden died?</div>
<div class="i2">For this! that Cromwell lopped a royal head as traitor knave?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
<div class="i2">For this! that all his cuirassiers were sworn to pray and shave?</div>
<div class="i0">Was it for this we lost a world! when George the Third was king?</div>
<div class="i0">For this! that laureates have lived of royal deeds to sing?</div>
<div class="i2">For this! the printing press was made, torpedoes, dynamite?</div>
<div class="i2">The iron ships, and bullet proof cuirass to scape the fight?</div>
<div class="i0">Was it for this! we've wove around the world a social net</div>
<div class="i0">Of speaking steel, that thou should'st perpetrate thy murder yet?</div>
<div class="i2">Out! out on thee! as traitor of thine oath unto the crown!</div>
<div class="i2">By gripping of thy butler, by his breech to jock him down,</div>
<div class="i0">Was it for this! that justice wrung thy neck on Tyburn tree,</div>
<div class="i0">To expiate the direful debt to justice due by thee?</div>
<div class="i2">For this! did Lord Macaulay write "The Lays of Antient Rome?"</div>
<div class="i2">For this! did Government send out to bring us Jabez home?</div>
<div class="i0">Have we been privileged to pay our swollen rates and tax?</div>
<div class="i0">And legislative rights imposed upon the noble's backs?</div>

<div class="i2">In Grosvenor Square, as captain of a hallelujah band,</div>

<div class="i0">For children's fears, or if thou would'st a manly vengeance dare,</div>

<div class="i0">So fiercely did I thus denounce, his evil midnight trick,</div>

<div class="i0">With quail of deep abasement, to behold a mortal's blood</div>
<div class="i0">On fire, to beard a felon spook, and ghosts were understood,</div>
<div class="i0">A transposition of remorse, upon his features came,</div>

<span class="hide">IN</span>
BURTON Crescent, on the semi-circle apex there,</div>
<div class="i0">I lodged some little period up a six flight four foot stair,</div>
<div class="i0">It came about by freak of chance, 'twas in a cul-de-sac,</div>
<div class="i2">I found myself one morning, and compelled to tramp it back,</div>
<div class="i0">Whilst blessing gates of London town that bar the traffic yet,</div>
<div class="i0">I saw a window label, lettered, "lodgings to be let,"</div>
<div class="i2">A gloomy habitation 'twas, to give the nerves the creep!</div>
<div class="i2">But possibly a comfortable roosting place to sleep,</div>
<div class="i0">Of knockers on its oaken door, it bore a double stock,</div>
<div class="i0">I took those knockers, and I struck duet of double knock,</div>
<div class="i2">And just as I was rounding off my rallantando din,</div>
<div class="i2">The door was gently opened and a lady cried "Come in!"</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span><div class="i0">I must confess, I fluttered with a flick of some surprise,</div>
<div class="i0">To see a lady so petite, and with such piercing eyes,</div>
<div class="i2">An artificial bloom was on her cheek, and nose, and neck,</div>
<div class="i2">Her gown was of a quaint brocade in antique floral check.</div>
<div class="i0">By transmutating hand of time, and his assistant care,</div>
<div class="i0">The golden sheen to silver light was paling thro' her hair,</div>
<div class="i2">And from the dentistry of art, that crowned her rippled chin,</div>
<div class="i2">She greeted me with pearly smile, the moment I stepped in.</div>
<div class="i0">I noted on her fingers small, some antique diamond rings,</div>
<div class="i0">And in her slippers russet brown, she tripped as 'twere on springs,</div>
<div class="i2">A dainty wrap, completed her little quaintly self,</div>
<div class="i2">She seemed a living Watteau, that stepped from off a shelf.</div>
<div class="i0">She seemed a living Watteau, from out a canvas sprung,</div>
<div class="i0">She wasn't&mdash;no, she wasn't&mdash;well you could not call her young.</div>
<div class="i2">She greeted me upsmiling, with business kindled fire,</div>
<div class="i2">And volunteered the question,</div>
<div class="i12">"What rooms do you require?"</div>
<div class="i0">It wasn't my intention, to move upon that day,</div>
<div class="i0">My humor was to dawdle, in idle sort of way,</div>
<div class="i2">So left it to her option, if twenty rooms or one,</div>
<div class="i2">In earth upon the basement, or garret near the sun.</div>
<div class="i0">She showed her approbation of my eccentric style,</div>
<div class="i0">And greeted me politely, with confidential smile,</div>
<div class="i2">"I have a room, the lodger is yet remaining there,</div>
<div class="i2">But leaving soon&mdash;I'll show it, if you will step the stair.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">She mounted up before me, her little cloak, like wings,</div>
<div class="i0">Did supplement her flexor, and her extensor springs,</div>
<div class="i2">She paused upon each lobby, to note the pleasing scene,</div>
<div class="i2">Of leaves amongst the chimneys, that lent a tint of green.</div>
<div class="i0">The sanitary question, she settled with some pains,</div>
<div class="i0">Explained, the County Council had just been down the drains,</div>

<div class="i2">And thus discussing features, and questions to be met,</div>
<div class="i2">We landed on the landing of lodging to be let.</div>
<div class="i0">Upon the door with knuckle she struck a low rum-tin,</div>
<div class="i0">And tardily was answered by husky voice "Come in."</div>
<div class="i2">To purpose of her visit, he gave a mild assent,</div>
<div class="i2">Which somewhat indicated a debt of backward rent.</div>
<div class="i0">We entered the apartment, and gaunt, and wan, and scared!</div>
<div class="i0">From tangle of the blankets, blear-eyed, and towsel-haired,</div>
<div class="i2">A moment rose the lodger, then underneath the clothes,</div>
<div class="i2">He snapped himself like oyster, and only left his nose.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I took a swift synopsis, again we stepped the stair,</div>
<div class="i0">She bowed me to her parlour, and all around me there,</div>

<div class="i2">Art of the reign of Louis, and good old Chippendale,</div>
<div class="i0">Cameo ware of Wedgewood, and Worcester bric-a-brac,</div>
<div class="i0">Miniatures of beauties, and oriental lac,</div>

<div class="i0">Old mezzotint engravings of Regent, buck and lord,</div>
<div class="i0">Between the window curtains, an agèd harpsichord.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">The instrument she fingered, and sang an olden rune,</div>
<div class="i0">She sang with taste, but slightly, the strings were out of tune,</div>
<div class="i2">She warbled of the Regent, of Sheridan and Burke,</div>
<div class="i2">Buck Nash, and of Beau Brummel, and of the fatal work,</div>
<div class="i0">Enacted in a duel, then struck a broken string,</div>
<div class="i0">And with a sigh she faltered, and then she ceased to sing.</div>
<div class="i0">I told her, composition of song, was in my line,</div>
<div class="i0">Then, with a look intended as tender and divine,</div>
<div class="i2">And mode of days of Brummel, in manner and in style,</div>
<div class="i2">She lauded up the bedroom with captivating smile,</div>
<div class="i0">Electro-biologic, magnetic in her glance,</div>
<div class="i0">She fixed me like a medium, as tenant in advance!</div>

<div class="i0">I entered occupation, as soon as I could get,</div>

<div class="i2">In this was comprehended the lot for which I paid,</div>
<div class="i2">My daily mastication, in public grill was frayed,</div>
<div class="i0">Monotonous, and easy, with quiet self-content,</div>
<div class="i0">I went and came in silence, in silence came and went,</div>
<div class="i2">Was no domestic welcome when I came in, not one!</div>

<div class="i0">No sound of brush or bucket! no jar of door, or delph!</div>
<div class="i0">No foot upon the stairs, except the pair I have myself!</div>

<div class="i2">No snarl of vicious lap dog, or hiss of humping cat!</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I had already promised myself, that none should boast,</div>
<div class="i0">Of knowing me in future, as tenant of a ghost,</div>

<div class="i2">And just as she was lifting my eagle pointed pen,</div>
<div class="i0">Said I "Perhaps you'll give me receipt for also this?"</div>
<div class="i0">With that I would have tested her presence with a kiss!</div>
<div class="i2">I think my arm went thro' her, of that I can't be sure,</div>

<div class="i0">I caught of her next landing, and on her hasty flight,</div>
<div class="i2">From lobby down to lobby I chased her like a hare,</div>
<div class="i2">I tracked her to the kitchen, but lo! she wasn't there!</div>
<div class="i0">I flew into the area, back up the stairs I flew,</div>
<div class="i0">In drawing-room and parlour, in every bedroom too,</div>
<div class="i2">To overtake and seize her, with skidding foot I sped,</div>
<div class="i2">And under every sofa, and under every bed,</div>

HE sun was setting in a gloam of
purple and gold, as I basked in the
grass on the Staball hill one
autumn evening, the stirring tuck
of the tattoo rolled up the slope
from the adjacent barracks; it
affected me like a tonic, my blood
circulated quicker, the spirit of an
amateur ghostly seer took possession
of me! I felt as one inspired.</p>

<p>A scene of early days of Anglo-foreign
strife rose before me like a wraith of second sight. The tramp of
sea-bound red coats, fifes and drums, the woe-mongering cries of parting
wives. I saw two lovers on the Staball hill, heard their vows.</p>

<p>A rhyming fever tingled to my fingers' ends, my only manuscript
medium to hand, the stump of a lead pencil, and blank margin of the
morning paper. Upon that virgin border I jotted the sketch of the
following founded on fact ballad. The reader will perceive in it a
beautiful inverse lesson of the mutual commotion of two loving hearts.</p>

<div class="i0">And many a gallant soldier, was bound unto the war,</div>

<div class="i0">Swore many a rounded warlike oath, that she should be his bride.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"O Maggie!" cried the Corporal, "There's war across the sea,</div>
<div class="i0">And when I'm parted from thee, I would you'd pray for me,</div>
<div class="i0">And I will tell you what you'll do, when I am far away,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And as the summer faded, and gloaming nights came round,</div>
<div class="i0">A maid anon was kneeling, upon that trysting ground,</div>

<div class="i0">That maiden sweet, and constant, unto her tryst would go.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Till on a certain evening, a stranger in the town,</div>

<div class="i0">"O what on earth possesses you, to pray upon the snow."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She told him all her story then, and why so kneeling there,</div>

ANY an intelligent reader will
perceive that the following is a
pathetic plaint founded on fact.
A moral, conveyed in a polyglot sample of
weak passages from many a knowing man's
career.</p>

<p>In one noted instance, the writer while reciting
the ballad, closely escaped the chance of assassination,
at the hand of a member of the audience,
that he fancied it was a versification of his own
particular experience, made public, and brought
so circumstantially home to him, that he felt
the eyes of all were concentrated upon him as the
hero of the ballad. Happily he did not carry a
revolver, or it would most likely have exploded suddenly in the direction
of the platform. But mutual explanations and further enquiry elicited
the information that more than one man of that audience occupied the
same lamplit boat of retrospect misfortune.</p>

<p>Corney Keegan relates his adventure with the picturesque force, derived
from practical experience, and many an aching heart will go out to him
in sympathy. His story teaches a comprehensive, solemn, and beautiful
lesson.</p>

<div class="i4">And all about a myth,</div>

<div class="i0">Then Rupert Smith, he minded of</div>
<div class="i4">The widow's wail, and tear,</div>
<div class="i0">And in remorse, he married her,</div>
<div class="i4">As consequence, I'm here!</div>

<div class="i4">To hot complexion grew,</div>

<div class="i4">A cause, for fighting too.</div>
<div class="i0">I knew a maid, and for her sake,</div>
<div class="i4">My daily life was fuss,</div>
<div class="i0">It is not always for a maid,</div>
<div class="i4">A man's affected thus;</div>
<div class="i0">But when she wasn't by my side,</div>
<div class="i4">I felt how lonely, space</div>
<div class="i0">Would be, if man could not behold,</div>
<div class="i4">A single woman's face.</div>
<div class="i0">And so I fondled, petted her,</div>

<p class="prose">AN instance of calculating foresight and
prudence is illustrated in the following
verses. If men would rely on the mutual
study of a spirit of equity, and enter more confidentially into the
claims of each, what beautiful pictures, of repentant resignation to a
just castigation, would be afforded, by certain of those who misunderstand
the rights of property. An excellent lesson of this kind, is taught
by the experience of the first tramp. He parted from the Farmer, with
comprehensive impressions, of the farmer's energy, and application to
business, a fact, which he took the earliest opportunity, of advertising in
the nearest hospital. Thro' the second case, also runs a beautiful lesson,
to the farmer, it may not have happed so well, as to the tramp, but the
record serves to show, that an action at law, should only result, as a
mutual alternative, agreeable to both parties; thereby the air of the Law
Courts, would be considerably purified, of the stuffiness, that oppresses the
impetuous litigant.</p>

MOST attractive lady, of middle class degree,</div>

<div class="i0">Said Pat O'Byrne. The lady, then gave a tender sigh,</div>
<div class="i0">She told them each, she loved him, and though her heart did bleed,</div>
<div class="i0">Expressed a wish, he'd combat on a small Arabian steed.</div>

<div class="i0">Of tournamental glory, you'll find it's now the thing,</div>
<div class="i0">To gild, with knightly glamour, your daring feat of strife,</div>
<div class="i0">And he who kills the other, I'll be his wedded wife;</div>
<div class="i0">Till then I'm Queen of beauty," so spake that lady fair,</div>
<div class="i0">"I give you both a fortnight, that each may well prepare,</div>

<div class="i0">(Her father dealt in horses), "now, sirs, good-night, and go."</div>

<div class="i0">They ne'er had used a weapon, they never strode a horse,</div>
<div class="i0">It was extremely awkward, and couldn't well be worse.</div>
<div class="i0">So while O'Gorman practised with foil, and mask. O'Byrne,</div>
<div class="i0">Was in a circus riding, and then he took his turn,</div>
<div class="i0">Before a fencing-master, to guard, and thrust, and fool,</div>
<div class="i0">While Pat O'Gorman, cantered around a riding school.</div>
<div class="i0">At length the fencing-master, he says to Pat O'Byrne,</div>
<div class="i0">"You're perfect mit ze fencing, you've nodings more to learn."</div>

<div class="i0">The fortnight was now over, the morning came at last,</div>
<div class="i0">The rising dawn, was ushered with snow, and biting blast,</div>
<div class="i0">As on the Fifteen Acres, all in the Ph&oelig;nix Park,</div>
<div class="i0">The duellists were waiting the Arab steeds, when, hark!</div>
<div class="i0">They heard a distant braying, as 'twere a trump of brass,</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas followed by a donkey, and then a second ass,</div>
<div class="i0">Came guided by his halter, unto the fated spot,</div>
<div class="i0">Said Pat O'Byrne and O'Gorman, "O, powdhers, this is rot!"</div>
<div class="i0">But yet a queen of beauty was their's the prize to win.</div>
<div class="i0">"We better pause no longer, but instantly pitch in,"</div>
<div class="i0">Said Pat O'Byrne, and Gorman. They tossed for choice of ass,</div>
<div class="i0">And pick of blade, then wheeling, they faced upon the grass.</div>
<div class="i0">I was for Kit O'Gorman a second on that day,</div>
<div class="i0">To see the flashing rapiers, to hear the donkeys bray</div>
<div class="i0">Was sight and sound to think of, the sylvan haunts were rife</div>
<div class="i0">With echoes reverbrated from crash of deadly strife;</div>
<div class="i0">Up went each donkey backwards, while scintillating wales</div>
<div class="i0">Of flashing steels, were echoed, by lashing of their tails,</div>
<div class="i0">For lo! the fight was doubled, the skittish donkeys sought,</div>
<div class="i0">To variegate the contest, and capered round, and fought;</div>
<div class="i0">They gave no chance. The foemen, with awkward clink of steels,</div>
<div class="i0">Struck now and then, while skew-ways the donkeys fought with heels,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas six o'clock commencing, and now, the strokes of ten,</div>
<div class="i0">Were sounding from the city, and still these mounted men,</div>
<div class="i0">Had not received abrasion, a cut, a prod, or crack,</div>
<div class="i0">When both were somersaulted, from off each asses' back;</div>
<div class="i0">The weapons went in splinters, as on the frosty grass,</div>
<div class="i0">Each foeman sprawled a moment, and loudly cursed his ass.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span><div class="i0">The assmen, quickly bounded unto their feet again,</div>
<div class="i0">And watched the seconds, chasing the donkeys round the plain;</div>
<div class="i0">And when at length, we caught them, and brought them back once more,</div>
<div class="i0">With fits of indignation, the baffled foemen swore;</div>
<div class="i0">"Bad scran to it!" said Gorman, "O'Musha, yis bad scran"</div>
<div class="i0">Cried Pat O'Byrne, "It's not a fight, for any dacent man,</div>
<div class="i0">Four mortial hours we've struggled&mdash;an' I'm all in a sweat!"</div>
<div class="i0">Said Gorman "Pon me sowl, I got no chance to kill ye yet!"</div>
<div class="i0">"The fight has been protracted, and divil a thing is done,</div>
<div class="i0">I vote we go and tell her", said O'Byrne, "that it's no fun,</div>
<div class="i0">To fight, as we've been fighting. Tib's Eve might come, and go,</div>

WHILE poking my umbrella into
the cracks and crannies that serve to
vary the monotonous setting of the
stones of a certain Pyramid of Egypt,
I scraped away a portion of mortar
or cement, and was agreeably surprised,
by discovering a roll, of what
I fondly hoped might be a bundle of
faded Bank of England notes; but
on closer inspection, it proved to be a
scroll of papyrus, thickly covered
with curious hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class="prose">They throw a misty light on the
history of the O'Tooles, for written
in a strange mingling of blank verse,
and ballad metre, they purport to give
a correct version of the account of
the Deluge; in which disaster, it
appears that a worthy ancestor of the
said family played a conspicuous, and
important part.</p>

<p class="prose">An Addenda accounting for their
presence in the pyramid is appended,
and contains the plausible statement,
that it was actually a descendant of
the said O'Toole, who designed and
built the tombs of the Pharoahs, and
adopted this subtle means of sending
his name down to these remote ages.</p>

<p class="prose">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>

Some savants and Egyptologists will cavil at this startling information,
but I happen to be in possession of a three cornered cypher that runs
thro' the composition of their architecture, which will be of convincing
merit, when I have time to issue the seven folio volumes, which I am not
preparing at present, in connection with this important subject.</p>

<p class="prose">The opening line proves that the Ballad must have been composed at a
much earlier period than that of the deluge.</p>

<p>
THE man who confidently seeks to
set up a new idea, by upsetting an old
theory, or tradition, is one who lives
in advance of his time, whereby he forfeits
many valued amenities of contemporaneous
courtesy. But he is to be extolled for the moral heroism
that impells him, to advance new facts, into the study of
history, or explode errors so steadfastly grounded on the popular belief, that
he finds himself, pen to pen with a hostile army of Savants, Antiquarians,
Historians, and Critics: some stirred with spirit of envy, others with a
craving for notoriety, but all unanimous, and up in arms, with loaded pens
and arsenal of inkpots.</p>

<p>In this regard I find myself, by placing the correct revision of a popular
tradition before my discerning readers.</p>

<p>I have to confess that it was not thro' deep and industrious research,
that I am thus enabled to challenge the truth, of the accepted records.</p>

<p>It was thro' the chance, afforded by an hour of breezing sea-scape
recreation, that I discovered the mysterious chronicle.</p>

<p>The popular tradition, is thus related by Dr. Walsh. "The celebrated
Grana Uille or Grace O'Mally, noted for her piratical depredations in the
reign of Elizabeth, returning on a certain time from England, where she
had paid a visit to the Queen, landed at Howth, and proceeded to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>castle. It was the hour of dinner&mdash;but the gates were shut. Shocked at an
exclusion so repugnant to her notions of Irish hospitality, she immediately
proceeded to the shore, where the young lord was at nurse, and seizing the
child, she embarked with, and sailed to Connaught, where her own castle
stood.</p>

<p>After a time, however, she restored the child; with the express stipulation,
that the gates should be thrown open, when the family went to dinner&mdash;a
practice which is observed to this day."</p>
</div>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">WHEN the Hill of Howth was covered, by a city great, and grand,</div>
<div class="i0">And nuggets still were gathered, like cockles on the strand;</div>
<div class="i0">On the shore, around by Sutton, a children's maid was met,</div>
<div class="i0">Who was wheeling of a baby, in a sky blue bassinet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And as that maiden cycled that infant by the sea,</div>
<div class="i0">Down the boreen from the Bailey, came number 90 B;</div>

<div class="i0">"We'll go and look for winkles, thro' seaweed on the rocks."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now whether or for winkles, or what it was they went,</div>
<div class="i0">They stayed away much longer than was their first intent,</div>

<div class="i0">"Howld on! I'll go, an' square it, I've got a schame, here goes!"</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The crafty rogue departed, and told the specious tale,</div>
<div class="i0">Of how the child was stolen by the Princess Granauille,</div>

<div class="i0">From information he received, that he had got a clew,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When Granauille was challenged, it struck her, she could make</div>
<div class="i0">A profitable bargain, in re her nephew's sake,</div>

<div class="i0">Her, when she found the outer door, at dinner time was locked!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She thought it mean, and stingy, the child she lifted then&mdash;</div>

<div class="prose">
<p>THE last car at night, is a vehicle laden with varied symptoms of
mysterious hauntings that more or less oppress the fares, some toned down
by the lassitude of overwork, drop gratefully into their seats, and quickly
fall into fitful slumber, others seem to court a spasmodic notoriety by loud
and disjointed converse. A weary of world expression clouds the features
of a few with an unuttered protest, for the disagreeable fact of their birth,
whilst others seem by their grumpy glances to suggest a jealous objection
to other people's existence.</p>

<p>A select few, unconsciously advertise a flippant gratification at the
possession of life, and squeeze festivity from it, as colour from a blue rag.
But all are haunted with the mysterious workings of unseen spirits, that
usually accompany the fares, in the latest car at night.</p>

<div class="i0">'Twas twenty-four o'clock; an hour that's oftimes deleterious</div>
<div class="i5">To many a liver wetted swell, pugnacious or emotional.</div>
<div class="i0">The beggared corporation lights, did flick in the nor'wester gale,</div>
<div class="i5">That blistering nose, and finger-tips, were loaded well with sleet,</div>
<div class="i0">When Binks harrangued a constable, "Good night, it's cold, you're looking pale,"</div>
<div class="i5">From where he backed a lamp-post, at the end of Brunswick Street.</div>
<div class="i0">"Ah! Sergeant," said Fitz-Binks, "It's late, or I could treat you decently,</div>

<div class="i0">But Chap, of Vic., is strict, they passed in Parliament so recently,"</div>
<div class="i5">The bobbie was a thirsty one, he winked a thirsty wink.</div>
<div class="i0">"Ha! ha!" said Binks, "You know the lines, so don't be too particular,</div>
<div class="i5">There's some back door that's open," said the constable, "you're right;</div>
<div class="i0">Just move an' there thro' yondher lane an' hide up perpendicular,</div>
<div class="i5">Beyant the lamp, I'll folly whin there's nobody in sight."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span><div class="i0">The thing was managed gracefully, and with an open sesamè,</div>
<div class="i5">The constable had stolen to a quiet bar with Binks,</div>
<div class="i0">Produced a clay, said he, "I hope yer honor won't think less of me,</div>
<div class="i5">To pull a pipe," "By Jove! I don't," said Binks, and bought the drinks.</div>
<div class="i0">The moment was so contraband, it gave unto that liquor bar,</div>
<div class="i5">A zest, he asked the constable to take another neat,</div>
<div class="i0">But lifting out his ticker, says the bobbie, "Well be quick or 'gar!</div>
<div class="i5">The sergeant might come whop on me! he's out upon his beat."</div>
<div class="i0">The constable decanted it, said he, "Howld on until I look,</div>
<div class="i5">Now fly!" said he, and while they dived again into the night,</div>
<div class="i0">He fished from out his overcoat, and deftly in his mouth he stuck,</div>
<div class="i5">A friendly lump of orris root, to make his breath all right.</div>
<div class="i0">That bobbie was a wily one, the act was rather opportune,</div>
<div class="i5">For they had scarcely managed to get half-way up the gut</div>
<div class="i0">When he was made aware that he must coin a whited whopper soon,</div>
<div class="i5">For hark! it was the tramping of the sergeant's heavy foot!</div>
<div class="i0">Said he, "We must dissimble, or I'm ruined, and a shapable,</div>
<div class="i5">Excuse I'll have to make!" * * *</div>
<div class="i0">* * * "What brings the two of you down here?"</div>
<div class="i0">"I'm makin' just a Pres'ner, Sir, he's dhrunk, an' he's incapable,"</div>
<div class="i5">Exclaimed the bobbie, gripping Binks, just under Binks's ear!</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas somewhat ominous for Binks, though he protested not, he chewed</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span><div class="i0">The cud of thought, until he saw that sergeant out of sight;</div>
<div class="i0">He had not comprehended yet, the patronising turpitude</div>
<div class="i5">Of bobbies, who will take a treat, "well now," said he, "good night,"</div>
<div class="i0">But spake that constable, said he, "good night is best for you, ye see,</div>
<div class="i5">But it won't answer now for me, I darn't let you go,</div>
<div class="i0">It's quietly, and aisily, and dacently, you'll come wid me,</div>
<div class="i5">Yer dhrunk, an' yer incapable! I towld the sergeant so."</div>
<div class="i0">Fitz-Binks fell plump in mire of doubt, 'twas shocking! thus to realize,</div>
<div class="i5">Such treachery, and subterfuge, of ingrate sneak of sin,</div>
<div class="i0">But 60 X was bigger in his figure, by a deal of size,</div>
<div class="i5">And little Binks, was little, so the bobbie ran him in!</div>
<div class="i0">The sergeant,&mdash;he who took the charge&mdash;was grave, and staid, particular!</div>
<div class="i5">He entered Binks upon his book, and sent him to the cell,</div>
<div class="i0">And Binks did forfeit half a sov., for standing perpendicular,</div>
<div class="i5">Before the Beak, and leaving court, he cursed that bobbie well!</div>
<div class="i0">He said the act was scandalous, and of the gutter order, he,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i5">That bobbie was, "Ah whisht! ye see, an' howld yer tongue, shut up</div>
<div class="i0">It's fond of me, you ought to be, if I swore ye wor disordherly,</div>
<div class="i5">It would have cost ye exthra, or you'd maybe be put up!"</div>
<div class="i0">It used to be a sermonising habit, and methodical,</div>
<div class="i5">To tag a moral story, with a warning at its end</div>
<div class="i0">And bobbie entertainments in the midnight, might be quodical!</div>
<div class="i5">So leave him to his duty, if you'd keep him as a friend.</div>

<div class="i0"><div class="dropcap">T</div>IM DOOLIN was a well known jock, an active sprite, and light and trim,</div>
<div class="i0">And time there was, that jocks did funk, to mount, and run the race with him.</div>
<div class="i0">He won by length, he won by head, he saved the race by nose, and ear,</div>
<div class="i0">Till all the jocks, around their pints, exclaimed the thing was devilish queer.</div>

<div class="i0">But fortune is a gay coquette; by fickle fortune, Doolin lost,</div>
<div class="i0">Till every one who backed him, soon did find him out a fraud and frost.</div>
<div class="i0">I've seen him lose at Punchestown, I've seen him last, at Baldoyle too,</div>
<div class="i0">At Fairyhouse I've seen him fall&mdash;his colours then were black and blue.</div>

<div class="i0">He stood and scratched his head amain, beside the stable door one night;</div>
<div class="i0">He had been drinking tints of malt, and felt as he were almost tight.</div>
<div class="i0">A race was on to run next day; he totted up his chance to win,</div>
<div class="i0">When turning thro' the stable-door, he saw a gentleman within!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">He thought the thing extremely strange, and asked the man, why he was there,</div>
<div class="i0">And stoutly gave the hint, that he was there, to sneak, and dose the mare.</div>
<div class="i0">The gentleman, he laughed a laugh. "I've backed the beast myself, by gum!</div>
<div class="i0">And you must win, or I will be the loser of a tidy sum."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Well, look," said Doolin, "pon me sowl, I have me doubts that she's in form."</div>
<div class="i0">The stranger glared at Doolin, and with voice, as of a rising storm,</div>
<div class="i0">Accused the jock of practices, that were not meet for honest men,</div>
<div class="i0">And asked him how he won so oft, and could not pass the post again?</div>
<div class="i0">"Well, yis, yer honor, 'pon me faith, it puzzles me the same as you,</div>
<div class="i0">That I can't jerk the horse ahead, and win as once I used to do.</div>
<div class="i0">I never drink before the race. I always pray before I mount:</div>
<div class="i0">And yet I find it's all the same; my prayers have come to no account!"</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
<div class="i0">"I used to curse and swear, but, ah, bedad, my swearing days are done!"</div>
<div class="i0">"Then how on earth could you expect to be the man who could get on?"</div>
<div class="i0">"I may not dare to curse and swear. I have a rich, religious aunt,</div>
<div class="i0">I'm in her will, and I would lose the fortune if I did, and shan't.</div>
<div class="i0">She often heard me curse and swear; but warning me one day, says she:</div>
<div class="i0">'If you go on to curse and swear, I'll have no more to do with thee!</div>
<div class="i0">I've made my will, and left you all my worldly goods, and money, too;</div>
<div class="i0">I've got it written, signed and sealed, so you be careful what you do!'</div>
<div class="i0">I promised her, upon my oath, that I would neither curse nor swear,</div>
<div class="i0">And I have kept my word, and I will keep my word to her, so there!</div>
<div class="i0">She lent to me a cockatoo, and cautioned me, I must not lack,</div>
<div class="i0">To treat him well; he's in the room I occupy, till she comes back."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Ah, that, indeed. Well, here's a tip: when in the morning you get up,</div>
<div class="i0">Keep cursing all the time you dress, and swear at night, before you sup,</div>
<div class="i0">By this no human ear will catch the oathings that will make you light,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span><div class="i0">And take a load from off your mind, and you will win the race&mdash;good night."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">That very night when he went home, he slyly locked the bedroom door,</div>
<div class="i0">And up and down around the room he scattered curses, and he swore,</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed before, he cursed behind, he cursed until his face was red,</div>
<div class="i0">By dint of cursing, and at last he stripped, and tumbled into bed.</div>
<div class="i0">Next morning many oaths he made, and sandwiched them with many a curse,</div>
<div class="i0">That sounded weird, and wry, and strange; his oathings they could not possibly be worse.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed because he had to rise, he cursed to leave the bed so nice,</div>
<div class="i0">And warm, and soft, he cursed because the water was as cold as ice.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed around the basin-stand, he cursed the water jug, alas!</div>
<div class="i0">The towel and the soap he cursed, with oath that almost broke the glass.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed a button that was loose, he cursed the thread and needle, new,</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the irritating starch, he cursed his washerwoman, too.</div>
<div class="i0">He curbed his braces&mdash;they were tied with bits of string, that broke in twain,</div>
<div class="i0">He fixed them with a pin; it stuck into his spine&mdash;he cursed again;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span><div class="i0">He cursed the postman for his knock&mdash;'twas by his tailor he was sent;</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the landlady who brought the bill; and asked him for the rent.</div>
<div class="i0">Before, behind, above, below, at right or left, he was not loath</div>
<div class="i0">To drop a detonating curse, or fling an alternating oath.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the razor and the strop, he cursed the wart upon his nose,</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed his hair that wouldn't grow, he cursed the corns upon his toes.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed a stud and button-hole that was too big; and in the street,</div>
<div class="i0">He saw a burly constable, and cursed the man upon his beat,</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the helmet on his head, the number on his collar, too;</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the stripe upon his arm, his mittens, and his suit of blue.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed his baton right and left, he cursed it also upside down,</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed him to the county gaol and back again, and into town.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the lining of his sleeve, a bottle in his pocket&mdash;who</div>
<div class="i0">Had put it there he could not tell&mdash;he cursed his aunt, her cockatoo.</div>
<div class="i0">He cursed the laces of his boots, the cockatoo he cursed again,</div>
<div class="i0">Again he swore, unlocked the door, and gaily started for the train.</div>
<div class="i0">Hurrah! he won the race that day, and everything for him went right,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
<div class="i0">And surreptitiously he cursed and swore, and cursed again that night.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A painful shocking thing, that men should stoop to acts like this, for fame or pelf.</div>
<div class="i0">Thro' all my friends there's not a man would act so shocking but himself.</div>
<div class="i0">His calender grew bright again with fortune's sunlight o'er it cast,</div>
<div class="i0">But there must be an end to such, and retribution comes at last.</div>
<div class="i0">His aunt returned to town again; he gave her back her cockatoo,</div>
<div class="i0">'Twere better he had slain him first; it's what, I think, and so will you.</div>
<div class="i0">One day a mortuary note did come&mdash;alas! his aunt was dead!</div>
<div class="i0">He buried her with decent haste, and then her latest will was read.</div>
<div class="i0">But by that testament, he found that he had not been left her purse,</div>
<div class="i0">It intimated this, that he had taught her cockatoo to curse!</div>
<div class="i0">It intimated this, that she thro' that, had met her death, alas;</div>
<div class="i0">And in a codicil expressed a wish they'd send the bird to grass.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">No mortal eye but his, beheld the deed he then essayed to do&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas murder! for he wrung the neck of his dead aunt, her cockatoo,</div>
<div class="i0">No mortal eye beheld the deed; but things again with him went queer,</div>
<div class="i0">Till one day looking down the street, he saw a stranger prowling near.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
<div class="i0">The man who told him thus to swear, 'twas on a dark November eve,</div>
<div class="i0">He knew that stranger held a secret stone for him inside his sleeve;</div>
<div class="i0">He knew that he had run a score of heavy debt, was due for sin,</div>
<div class="i0">And darting back, he closed the door. Said he to Bridget "I'm not in.</div>
<div class="i0">Just say that I am out," said he, and quickly up the stairs he flew,</div>
<div class="i0">The stranger knocked. "Ah, let me see," and up the stairs he mounted, too.</div>
<div class="i0">The servant sneaked the key-hole then, and saw a struggle on the bed,</div>
<div class="i0">Then ran below&mdash;"Mavrone, asthore, come up, agrah, the lodger's dead!"</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The moral is of gentlemen you do not know, you should beware:</div>
<div class="i0">You should not use your bedroom, for a hiding-place, to curse, and swear.</div>
<div class="i0">To curse a harmless constable upon his beat, is even worse;</div>
<div class="i0">'Twas he who caught the jurymen, who gave the verdict on his corse.</div>
<div class="i0">That shocking room is haunted now; it may not raise a shock in you,</div>
<div class="i0">But every dark November eve, there comes a shrouded cockatoo,</div>
<div class="i0">And gliding in his pallid shirt, a wretched spectre doth rehearse,</div>
<div class="i0">The record of his oathings dire! the cockatoo then shrieks a curse!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
<div class="i0">The man of easy habits then will see the deadly deed anew,</div>
<div class="i0">Of how the neck was wrung by him, who slew his aunt, her cockatoo.</div>
<div class="i0">The man of easy habits then, will see the evil sprite of gloom,</div>
<div class="i0">Come prowling for his guilty soul, and bear it down the trap of doom.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The landlady can never make the lodgers in that room content,</div>
<div class="i0">They never stay, beyond the day that she has asked them for the rent,</div>
<div class="i0">But men are not so wicked now; they will not swear an oath for pelf.</div>
<div class="i0">They're much about the same as you&mdash;almost exactly like myself.</div>

<div class="i8">You could not hear a stir</div>
<div class="i0">When turning round a corner, I heard the music sweet,</div>

<div class="i0">With the semi-grand piano, was wonderful, and rare!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I waited on in rapture, and harkened to the strain,</div>

<div class="i0">I thought it might remind her, of the troubadours of old,</div>
<div class="i0">Tho' 'twasn't too romantic, for the night was dev'lish cold!</div>
<div class="i0">It wasn't all Italian, but it was much the same,</div>

<div class="i0">The busses and the tramcars, but still they always found</div>
<div class="i0">That busy ghost around them, their lives could not be worse.</div>
<div class="i0">"O thunder!" shrieked the bridegroom, "I'll seek for a divorce."</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But when the court was opened, the judge refused to sit,</div>
<div class="i0">For every pleading lawyer had got a sneezing fit;</div>

<h2><small>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS <br />
ON</small> <br />
<strong>THE BARNEY BRADEY BROCHURES</strong> <br />

<small>BY</small> <br />

WM. THEODORE PARKES.</h2>

<div class="prose">
<p>"It is pleasant to turn from these gloomy details to the hearty, rollicking, honest, joyous
spirit of Barney Bradey. He sings the Prince's Installation to the tune to which <em>Ingoldsby</em>
sang the Queen's Coronation, and with very much of the same spirit and success. The
details are full of real good humour, and are thus picturesquely concluded with a touch of the
Ulster King at Arms....
Barney Bradey's eye was pretty well everywhere but it failed to see one incident of the
day.... All this is worthy of being sung by such a bard as the author of 'St. Patrick's
Ruction.'"&mdash;<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

<p>"Most people know Barney Bradey, and the more you know of him the better you like
him. Perhaps very few of your comic poets have achieved such legitimate success as
Barney, whether in 'St. Patrick's Ruction' or, the 'Queer Papers,' or even in the fugitive
pieces which come to us from time to time. The whole story of Napoleon's war is told in
verse, with a genuine Irish humour, abounding in good points and suggestive images. The
fun is quite of an original kind, and is really <em>sui generis</em>. The author has great command of
language, expressive yet simple, and manages meter with uncommon skill. The strange
inversions, provoking hyberbole, and quaint terms characteristic of Irish humour, are here
lavishly displayed; and the man who would not laugh with Barney, while yet appreciating
his satirical truth, must be unhappy indeed. The range of thought, though extensive, is
very germane, and the humourist discovers a tinge of that Byronic happiness in soaring high
and still keeping the game in sight. We regret that we cannot quote a stanza or two from
'The Christening Cake' to prove to our readers that our praise is as well deserved as it is
genuine."&mdash;<cite>Freeman's Journal.</cite></p>

<p>"This is a humourous extravaganza, by the author of 'St. Patrick's Ruction' and other
comic rhymes, and is characterized by the same cleverness and quaint drollery. The
'baptism of fire,' the proclamations, letters, telegrams, projects, and incidents of the war, are
represented in fantastic forms of illustration. The effect is as ridiculous as the author intends
it to be."&mdash;<cite>Daily Express.</cite></p>

<p>"Welcome Barney!&mdash;In many a quaint, merry, and most grotesque "fytte," our
rollicking Irish Rabelais runs over the most marked opening incidents of the Franco-Prussian
war. All the outlandishness of diction; the funniness of Hibernian phonetic spelling; the
strange, wild, yet always true, similes and comparisons; the madcap, boisterous, merry-making
that characterized 'St. Patrick's Ruction,' and the 'Queer Papers,' are repeated,
equalled, aye, surpassed in the <span class="smcap">Christening Cake</span>. Barney's history of the war ends at
Saarbruck. We long to hear him on Weissembourg, Sedan, Strasbourg, Metz, and Paris.
We lately noticed 'St. Patrick's Ruction,' a work as full of real Irish witticisms as any we
ever perused, and one that has won its author unstinted praise. The orthography of the
present brochure is as comically outrageous, the similes and comparisons as far-fetched, and
yet as true to nature&mdash;the whole dainty tome as full of genuine, rollicking, open-hearted
Irish fun and humour as 'The Installation' or 'Sods from Puncherstown.' It is pathetic,
comical&mdash;true to nature, true to art."&mdash;<cite>Tyrone Constitution.</cite></p>

<p>"It is seldom in these days that one comes upon anything thoroughly and undeniably
Irish in the matter of witty writing. But the productions of 'Barney Bradey' are a
refreshing exception to this doleful rule. In 'St. Patrick's Ruction,' and the 'Queer Papers,'
we rejoiced to find that an original had arisen among us; and now, in another production,
we are pleased to see our first opinion verified. The design of the piece lies in the combination
of fifteen poems in one 'harmonious whole.' The story ends with the capture of
Saarbruck, and all throughout runs a vein of most pungent and telling satire."&mdash;<cite>Post.</cite></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>

"The clever author of 'St. Patrick's Ruction has presented the public with another
exceedingly witty pamphlet. The language is well chosen, and is sure heartily to amuse
the reader; there is a vein of well-directed satire in every line that exhibits the thoughtfulness
of the apparent careless writer."&mdash;<cite>Limerick Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney sings in Anglo-Irish doggrel of the most exquisite and original kind. His
readers, whose name is legion, will find him quite as entertaining in those 'Queer Papers' as
when his comet-like genius first blazed upon the world in 'St. Patrick's Ruction."&mdash;<cite>Limerick
Reporter.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey is a poet of no ordinary powers. It is not going too far to say that he has
acquitted himself to his own satisfaction, and also to that of others. His orthography is
peculiar, and his fun and wit are thoroughly Irish. The droll and clever Barney is a queer
character, but he is so full of humour and says so many witty things that he must become a
favourite with every one."&mdash;<cite>Dundalk Democrat.</cite></p>

<p>"This poem under notice is merry in the extreme, and displays an accurate knowledge of
Irish character, and of the peculiar English in which it likes to display itself. The author
wishes everybody to be agreeable, and sets a good example himself. Here is a description of
the ladies present at the installation service, full of the gentlest satire.... In addition,
there is prose, entitled 'Sods from the Turf of Puncherstown.' It makes merry, but most
good-humouredly, with everybody and everything, and by many readers will be regarded as
fully equal to most of Artemus Ward's attempts. We have not seen his 'Tails and Ballids,'
but it is spoken of highly, and we do not think the present attempt is deserving of less praise."&mdash;<cite>Portadown
News.</cite></p>

<p>"This is a whimsical and clever little production, written in a style of orthography
peculiarly its own, and conveying a vast amount of humour. The lines entitled 'O Law!
there's a Star from the Sky,' are rich and full of humorous comicality, greatly heightened by
their droll versification."&mdash;<cite>Derry Journal.</cite></p>

<p>"The grand processions, crushing, crowding, cheering, are all graphically detailed by the
poetic 'Barney.' Altogether, a very pleasant hour may be spent in company with our
facetious friend, 'Barney Bradey.'"&mdash;<cite>Carlow Sentinel.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey has acquired considerable success in his treatment of Irish wit and
character, partly in prose and partly in poetry: the latter runs on in a clear stream of
merriment, while the former, with rollicking fun, possesses an undercurrent of light wit, and
occasionally of caustic sarcasm. Taken as a whole the little book is exceedingly readable,
and as a bold venture on a very delicate field of literature, may be looked on as a decided
success."&mdash;<cite>Herald.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey will cause a merry laugh to many by his piquant humour and droll
conceits. They display at times an acuteness of observation and a pungency of wit which is
heightened by the quaint mode of expression used."&mdash;<cite>King's County Chronicle.</cite></p>

<p>"Over Barney Bradey's Papers every reader is sure to laugh. They are full of fun and
jollity. The only fault is their brevity."&mdash;<cite>Malvern News.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey is one gem of the Isle. He understands the 'boys,' and expresses their
opinions in a very cute sensible way."&mdash;<cite>Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey's Papers are so droll that we cannot do better than give our readers the
one 'Matrimonial.'"&mdash;<cite>Eastern Post.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey's Papers will afford considerable amusement.'&mdash;<cite>Ayrshire Express.</cite></p>

<p>"Barney Bradey's Papers are full of genuine humour."&mdash;<cite>Greenwich Gazette.</cite></p>

<p>"The facetious style has an excellent exponent in the person of Barney Bradey."&mdash;<cite>Brighton
Daily News.</cite></p>

<p>"Prose or verse come equally facile to his exceedingly humorous and racy pen."&mdash;<cite>Ecclesiastical
Gazette.</cite></p>
